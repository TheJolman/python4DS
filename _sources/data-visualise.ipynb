    "\n",
    "There are a plethora of other options (and packages) for data visualisation using code. There are broadly two categories of approach to using code to create data visualisations: imperative, where you build what you want, and declarative, where you say what you want. Choosing which to use involves a trade-off: imperative libraries offer you flexibility but at the cost of some verbosity; declarative libraries offer you a quick way to plot your data, but only if itâ€™s in the right format to begin with, and customisation may be more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "**seaborn** is a declarative visualisation package, and these can be easier to get started with. But it's built on top of an imperative package, the incredibly powerful **matplotlib**, so you can always dig further and tweak details if you need to. However, in this chapter, we'll focus on using **seaborn** declaratively."
