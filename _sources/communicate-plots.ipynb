    "# Graphics for Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn about using visualisation to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a plethora of options (and packages) for data visualisation using code. First, though a note about the different philosophies of data visualisation. There are broadly two categories of approach to using code to create data visualisations: imperative, where you build what you want, and declarative, where you say what you want. Choosing which to use involves a trade-off: imperative libraries offer you flexibility but at the cost of some verbosity; declarative libraries offer you a quick way to plot your data, but only if it’s in the right format to begin with, and customisation may be more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also different purposes of data visualisation. It can be useful to bear in mind the three broad categories of visualisation that are out there:\n",
    "\n",
    "- exploratory\n",
    "\n",
    "- scientific\n",
    "\n",
    "- narrative\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has packages that cover all three of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "In {ref}`exploratory-data-analysis`, you learned how to use plots as tools for *exploration*.\n",
    "When you make exploratory plots, you know---even before looking---which variables the plot will display.\n",
    "You made each plot for a purpose, could quickly look at it, and then move on to the next plot.\n",
    "In the course of most analyses, you'll produce tens or hundreds of plots, most of which are immediately thrown away. Exploratory visualisation is usually quick and dirty, and flexible too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second kind, *scientific visualisation*, is the prime cut of your exploratory visualisation. It’s the kind of plot you might include in a more technical paper, the picture that says a thousand words. The first image of a black hole {cite}`akiyama2019first` is a prime example of this. You can get away with having a high density of information in a scientific plot because it's designed for specialists. Ensuring that important values can be accurately read from the plot is especially important in these kinds of charts. But they can also be the kind of plot that presents the killer results in a study; they might not be exciting to people who don’t look at charts for a living, but they might be exciting and, just as importantly, understandable by your peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and final kind is *narrative visualisation*, and it is the focus of this chapter—though we'll only scratch the surface. This is the one that requires the most thought in the step where you go from the first view to the end product because your audience will likely not share your background knowledge and will not be deeply invested in the data. It’s a visualisation that doesn’t just show a picture, but gives an insight. These are the kind of visualisations that you might see in the Financial Times, The Economist, or on the BBC News website. They come with aids that help the viewer focus on the aspects that the creator wanted them to (you can think of these aids or focuses as doing for visualisation what bold font does for text). They’re well worth using in your work, especially if you’re trying to communicate a particular narrative, and especially if the people you’re communicating with don’t have deep knowledge of the topic. You might use them in a paper that you hope will have a wide readership, in a blog post summarising your work, or in a report intended for a policymaker."
