    "In this chapter, you're going to learn about packages and how to install them plus virtual coding environments that keep your packages isolated and your projects reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages (also called libraries) are key to extending the functionality of Python. The default installation of Anaconda comes with many (around 250) of the packages you'll need, but it won't be long before you'll need to install some extra ones. There are packages for geoscience, for building websites, for analysing genetic data, for economics—pretty much for anything you can think of. Packages are typically not written by the core maintainers of the Python language but by enthusiasts, firms, researchers, academics, all sorts! Because anyone can write packages, they vary widely in their quality and usefulness. There are some that you'll be seeing them again and again.\n",

    "\n",
    "The three Python packages **numpy**, **pandas**, and **maplotlib**, which respectively provide numerical, data analysis, and plotting functionality, are ubiquitous. So many scripts begin by importing all three of them, as in the tweet above!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically two steps to using a new Python package:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *install* the package on the command line (aka the terminal), eg using `pip install pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *import* the package into your Python session, eg using `import pandas as pd`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you issue an install command for a specific package, it is automatically downloaded from the internet and installed in the appropriate place on your computer. To install extra Python packages, you issue install commands to a text-based window called the \"terminal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Command Line in Brief\n",
    "\n",
    "The *terminal* or *command line* or sometimes the *command prompt* was labelled 4 in the screenshot of Visual Studio Code from the chapter on {ref}`introduction`. The terminal is a text-based way to issue all kinds of commands to your computer (not just Python commands) and knowing a little bit about it is really useful for coding (and more) because managing packages, environments (which we haven't yet discussed), and version control (ditto) can all be done via the terminal. We'll come to these in due course in the chapter on {ref}`command-line`, but for now, a little background on what the terminal is and what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "To open up the command line within Visual Studio Code, use the <kbd>⌃</kbd> + <kbd>\\`</kbd> keyboard shortcut (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>\\`</kbd> (Windows/Linux), or click \"View > Terminal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows users may find it easiest to use the Anaconda Prompt as their terminal, at least for installing Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to open up the command line independently of Visual Studio Code, search for \"Terminal\" on Mac and Linux, and \"Anaconda Prompt\" on Windows. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, everything you can do by clicking on icons to launch programmes on your computer, you can also do via the terminal, also known as the command line. For many programmes, a lot of their functionality can be accessed using the command line, and other programmes *only* have a command line interface (CLI), including some that are used for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "The command line interacts with your operating system and is used to create, activate, or change python installations.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Visual Studio Code to open a terminal window by clicking Terminal -> New Terminal on the list of commands at the very top of the window. If you have installed the Anaconda distribution of Python, your terminal should look something like this as your 'command prompt':\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(base) your-username@your-computer current-directory %\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "on Mac, and the same but with '%' replaced by '$' on linux, and (using the Anaconda Prompt)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(base) C:\\Users\\YourUsername>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "on Windows. If you don't see the word `(base)` at the start of the line, you may need to type `conda activate` first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `(base)` part is saying that your current Python environment is the base one (later, we'll see how to add others for reproducibility and to isolate projects). Unfortunately, and confusingly, the commands that you can use in the terminal on Mac and Linux, on the one hand, and Windows, on the other, are different but many of the principles are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, to at least try out the command line, let's use something that works across all three of the major operating systems. Type `python` on the command prompt that came up in your new terminal window. You should see information about your installation of Python appear, including the version, followed by a Python prompt that looks like `>>>`. This is a kind of interactive Python session, in the terminal. It's much less rich than the one available in Visual Studio Code (it can't run scripts line-by-line, for example) but you can try `print('Hello World!')` and it will run, printing your message. To exit the terminal-based Python session, type `exit()` to go back to the regular command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "To install extra Python packages, the default and easiest way is to use `pip install **packagename**`. In true programming-humour style, pip is a recursive acronym that stands for 'pip install packages'. There are over 330,000 Python packages on PyPI (the Python Package Index)! You can see what packages you have installed already by running `conda list` into the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install ...` will install packages into your default Anaconda environment, usually called \"base\". You'll need to have Anaconda \"activated\" before installing a package in the terminal--if you don't see the name of an environment, eg `(base)`, at the start of your terminal's line, use the `conda activate` command first. On Windows, this is usually the command prompt (available in the integrated Visual Studio Code terminal) or the Anaconda Command Prompt (available in the start menu).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a second way to install packages that directly uses `conda` instead of `pip`, which we'll come to shortly in the context of different Python environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a full example of the commands used to install the **pandas** package into the base environment (you may not need the first one):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "your-username@your-computer current-directory % conda activate\n",
    "(base) your-username@your-computer current-directory % pip install pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    "Try installing the **matplotlib**, **pandas**, **statsmodels**, and **skimpy** packages using `pip install`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have installed a package, you need to be able to use it! This is usually done via an import statement at the top of your script or Jupyter Notebook. For example, to bring in **pandas**, it's\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does Python do this? The idea of not just loading every package is to provide clarity over what function is being called from what package. It's also not necessary to load every package for every piece of analysis, and you often actually want to know what the *minimum* set of packages is to reproduce an analysis. Making the package imports explicit helps with all of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also wonder why one doesn't just use `import pandas as pandas`. There's actually nothing stopping you doing this except i) it's convenient to have a shorter name and ii) there does tend to be a convention around imports, ie `pd` for **pandas** and `np` for **numpy**, and your code will be clearer to yourself and others if you follow the conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Code Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual code environments allow you to isolate all of the packages that you're using to do analysis for one project from the set of packages you might need for a different project. They're an important part of creating a reproducible analytical pipeline but a key benefit is that others can reproduce the environment you used and it's best practice to have an isolated environment per project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more concrete, let's say you're using Python 3.9, **statsmodels**, and **pandas** for one project, project A. And, for project B, you need to use Python 3.10 with **numpy** and **scikit-learn**. Even with the same version of Python, best practice would be to have two separate virtual Python environments: environment A, with everything needed for project A, and environment B, with everything needed for project B. For the case where you're using different versions of Python, this isn't just best practice, it's essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages now come with an option to install packages and a version of the language in isolated environments. In Python, there are multiple tools for managing different environments. And, of those, the easiest to work with is probably [**Anaconda**](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) (conda for short).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda as a package manager\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn how to use virtual code environments, we need to make a brief detour into `conda` as a package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda does more than just provide a Python interpreter: it can also manage packages and *different* Python installations, aka Python environments. So you can also install packages with\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install package-name -c conda-forge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will try to install a version of the package that is already optimised for your type of computer, and will automatically come with any dependencies (packages the package you're installing needs to run). The pre-built packages that are provided by Anaconda are convenient for a host of reasons. Anaconda provide pre-built versions of around 7,500 of the most popular packages (including the statistical programming language R). This is far less than PyPI but what you tend to find in practice is that Anaconda's `conda-forge` channel (`-c` selects the `conda-forge` \"channel\") has most of what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so how does this help with creating virtual environments? Because `conda install ...` is able to select versions of packages that work well with your computer, it's good at finding a combination of packages that will work well together without issue. With so many packages on PyPI, not all versions of all packages work together! Conda aims to solve that problem, and it makes working with virtual environments much nicer. But you can still `pip install ...` in a specific conda environment when you need to (eg because that particular package isn't available on `conda-forge`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see all of the packages in your (currently activated) conda environment by running `conda list` on the command line. This book uses a conda environment, and here's an example of looking at the installed packages within it, filtering them just to the ones beginning with \"s\". You can see which packages are from `conda-forge` and which are from PyPI."

    "### Using Anaconda to Manage Python Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, we're now ready to look at using conda to manager Python environments. Much of these two subsections is covered by the Anaconda documentation on [managing virtual environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Anaconda, you manage and change environments on the command line (remember, there's much more on the command line in {ref}`command-line`). Before following these instructions, check that you have Anaconda installed and activated. You should see something like `(base) username@computername:~$` on the command line (base is the default conda environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new environment called \"myenv\" with a specific version of Python (but no extra packages installed), it's\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n myenv python=3.8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where you can of course specify other versions of Python by changing the number. To throw in a package or two, just add them to the end, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n myenv python=3.8 pandas jupyter\n",
    "```\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "conda env list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you install Anaconda, you will begin with a \"base\" environment. As noted, it's best practice not to use this for projects but to instead to create a new environment for each project.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two downsides to installing environments directly from the command line. One is that you may have lots of packages. The second is that you may wish to keep a record of the environment you created! This is really good practice, because it helps you to make your work more reproducible. For both of these reasons, you can specify a conda environment using a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple environment that just had pandas and an interactive console would look like this in a file:\n",
    "\n",

    "  - pandas\n",
    "  - jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "The environment is given by `name`, the channel (where to look for the packages) by `channels`, the specific packages by `dependencies`. Not all packages are available on conda's channels, so sometimes extra ones are needed. By specifying `conda-forge` we get the widest possible selection of packages. But, as we noted before, some packages are only available on PyPI (`pip`); these can be specified with a sub-section of the file like so for the **skimpy** package:\n",
